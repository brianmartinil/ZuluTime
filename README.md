# ZuluTime

This is a super simple watch face for Garmin Vivoactive HR smart watches.

It shows:
* Local time in 12 or 24 hour format
* Month and day of month
* Zulu (UTC) time
* Battery and Bluetooth status

That's it.

You can change and compile it yourself with the [Connect IQ SDK](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/).  If you just want to install the watch
face, connect your Vivoactive HR to your computer with the charging cable
and copy the `ZuluTime.prg` file to the `/GARMIN/APPS` directory on the watch.
